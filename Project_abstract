The project "Enhancing Agricultural Advisory Services with Multilingual LLaMA and RAG" aims to simplify access to government schemes and agricultural advisories for farmers. 
It uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, powered by the LLaMA language model, to provide accurate, up-to-date information from a regularly updated knowledge base. 
The system also includes an automated form-filling feature that helps farmers quickly and accurately complete scheme applications by extracting relevant information from their inputs.
